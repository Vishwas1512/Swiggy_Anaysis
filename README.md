# Swiggy Data Analysis Project
**Project Overview**
This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of a dataset from Swiggy, one of India’s leading food delivery platforms. The analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), SQL-based queries, and visualizations using Power BI to provide critical business insights related to restaurant performance, customer preferences, delivery times, and more.

**Project Components**
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Performed EDA to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and understand relationships within the dataset.
Investigated variables such as Price, Restaurant Ratings, Delivery Times, and Cuisine Preferences.
Visualized key insights using plots and charts to make the findings more intuitive.
**SQL Analysis:**

Utilized SQL queries to draw comprehensive insights from the data.
**Key SQL queries used:**
Finding top restaurants based on average ratings.
Identifying total revenue per restaurant.
Customer demographic analysis (e.g., orders per city).
Delivery time analysis by area.
Data was extracted, transformed, and analyzed using advanced SQL techniques such as joins and groupings to answer key business questions.

**Dashboard in Power BI:**

Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights from the data.
Dashboard includes:
Top 10 restaurants by ratings.
Delivery time by area visualization.
Restaurant pricing comparison.
Total orders and revenue per restaurant.
The dashboard allows users to interactively filter and drill down into specific areas of interest, helping Swiggy make more data-driven decisions.
Dataset
Source: The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle.
Contents: It includes information such as restaurant names, areas, cities, prices, delivery times, food types, average ratings, and total ratings.
Key Insights
Restaurant Performance: High-rated restaurants like Kim Lee (4.4) offer a premium dining experience at a higher price (₹650), while others, such as New Punjabi Hotel, offer lower pricing but also slightly lower ratings.
Delivery Time Optimization: Areas like Indiranagar have longer delivery times, highlighting the need for optimization in delivery operations.
Cuisine Preferences: Diverse cuisine offerings, such as those from Tandoor Hut (Biryani, Chinese, North Indian), cater to a wide range of customers, which can help Swiggy improve restaurant selection.
Customer Demand: Popular areas such as Koramangala and Indiranagar in Bangalore show significant customer engagement, indicating high delivery demand in these regions.
How to Run the Project

**SQL Analysis:**
SQL scripts for querying the dataset are provided in the sql_analysis.sql file. You can run these queries using MySQL or any SQL tool of your choice.

**EDA:**
The Python code for the EDA can be found in the eda_analysis.py file. It uses libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
To execute the code, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can run the script using any Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook.

**Power BI Dashboard:**
The Power BI dashboard file (swiggy_dashboard.pbix) is available in the repository.
Open it using Microsoft Power BI Desktop to interact with the dashboard and visualize the insights.

**Technologies Used**

SQL for data querying and analysis.
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data manipulation and visualization during the EDA phase.
Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and visual reports.
Jupyter Notebook and MySQL for scripting and running SQL queries.

**Conclusion**
This project provides critical insights into Swiggy’s operations, helping to optimize restaurant offerings, improve delivery efficiency, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. The combination of EDA, SQL analysis, and Power BI visualizations allows for deep insights that can drive better decision-making.
